# project_euler
This repository was built to maintain my solutions to Project Euler archives.

Conceptually, the program has an "engine" which supports a configurable number of parameters based on a given archive number (which dictates parameter parsing).

This driver class parses the parameters and then initializes an instance of the class which the algorithm is defined within.
